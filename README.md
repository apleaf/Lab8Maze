Funcionality

I received a check plus on my Pre Lab, and had requiered functionality and B functionality checked off on 9 December.  I could not get A functionality.


###Objective

The objective of this lab was to combine Lab 7 with Lab 6 and have the robot navigate the maze.

###Software
I went with the method which followed along the left wall and made corrections based on when the sensor was either too far or too close to the wall.  I think using this method was what gave me trouble achieving A functionality.

###Debugging

My robot would not detect walls at first, and would continue going straight and hit the wall straight ahead.  I changed the sensitivity of the sensors, and while that helped it detect walls, it was still having trouble navigating.  After speaking with Dr. Coulston, I changed the timing on my code and the robot was able to navigate to the second exit.  My robot kept getting stuck at the right turn where the second exit was located, which was needed to make the third exit and achieve A functionality.  I played around with the code and tried changing some of the timing and sensitivity of the sensors, but still could not get A functionality.

###Conclusion
This lab took a lot more time than I thought it was going to combining the parts from lab 6 and lab 7.  The sensors would seem to work, and then suddenly not work as well.
